        Luke Hemmings is my fav glitter boy, my fav singer. Here are lyrics from
        some of my favorite songs by him. Comedown It's been a hell of a week
        Have I left this bedroom yet? I'll sleep this life away 'Til I see a
        reflection I can speak to With a cold breeze Maybe I can soon forget
        I'll wash away the bleach And clear reflections I can see through All my
        life I've been breaking this horse Breakin' these same old wishin' bones
        Hopin' they'd bring me back to course All my life I've been passin' this
        blame And once you get on, you won't ever get off And won't be the same
        Let it come down on me Let me see all the things that I was supposed to
        see Light up a darkness I was never meant to Climb out of like a
        bursting sunrise from the deepest sleep A change of heart and a silver
        linin' down on Camellia Street Let it come down on me I've been movin'
        away Fallin' down these Penrose steps They're always diggin' at my heels
        To pull me back into the dark room Through the doorway Seein' these
        colors creepin' in They give me somethin' I can feel As the seconds
        start to take bloom, mm All my life I've been breakin' this horse
        Breakin' these same old wishin' bones Hopin' they'd bring me back to
        course All my life I've been passing this blame And once you get on, you
        won't ever get off And won't be the same Let it come down on me Let me
        see all the things that I was supposed to see Light up a darkness I was
        never meant to Climb out of like a bursting sunrise from the deepest
        sleep A change of heart and a silver linin' down on Camellia Street Let
        it come down on me Tell me you need me, oh Tell me you need me, oh Let
        it come down on me (tell me you need me) Come down, come down (oh) Come
        down (Tell me you need me) Come down, come down (oh) Come down Oh, let
        it come down on me (tell me you need me) Come down, come down (oh) Come
        down (Tell me you need me) Come down, come down (oh) Come down. Mum.
        Mum, I'm sorry, I stopped calling Don't know what the hell I was caught
        in Can't stop dreaming of chandeliers And your voice is all I hear I'm
        so heavy Jump into my ocean Can't you see me sinking? Love the fear of
        falling Don't you know I'm too young? Can't you hear me calling you?
        Nothing hurts me now Mum, I'm sorry, I'm still falling I'll be home
        December morning I keep those dreams like souvenirs Always ringing in my
        ear Yeah, it's in my head And I'm shutting it out Can you hear? Can you
        hear me? All the things I did Just drown it out Just drown it out I'm so
        heavy Jump into my ocean Can't you see me sinking? Love the fear of
        falling Don't you know I'm too young? Won't you hear me calling you?
        Nothing hurts me now Trying to find the way it was Trying to find the
        way Trying to find the way it was I see you in everything Trying to find
        the way it was Trying to find the way Trying to find the way it was I
        see you in everything. Diamonds. Cut like diamonds and sink like stones
        Starve myself 'til I'm skin and bones I'm so much older than I ever
        thought I would be Hold the silence and don't let go I hurt the people I
        love the most I'm so much colder than I ever wanted to be So how far is
        far? Are we too deep in? How dark is dark? I need to see it I'm on the
        way out, losing the dream I feel it crash down, down on me Caught in the
        madness, it's holding on me Is this the way it will always be? There's
        some things that I'll never know Past the limit it's come and gone Watch
        the bright eyes as they slowly sink into sleep And that same old silence
        that I've come to know Every time I find it when there's nowhere left to
        go Tell me, how far is far? Are we too deep in? How dark is dark? I need
        to see it I'm on the way out, losing the dream I feel it crash down,
        down on me Caught in the madness, it's holding on me Is this the way it
        will always be? Garden Life. You were a pillow I was the dark room It's
        ones and zeros Yet life in full bloom You shape the feeling I just mould
        around you It's so dark and dreary Please find the sun soon You left a
        dent inside my soul I know, I know I'm on the edge, where do I go? Ooh I
        feel most alive Staring out your window It's a garden life You are the
        weeping willow And I am alcohol Swimming through your system Lulling you
        to sleep On and on we dream What comes after me? What comes after me? My
        eyes are filming Turn off the evening news The train is leaving Won't
        wait for you It's a short buzz For a long night It's a lifetime I can't
        watch you cry I feel most alive Staring out your window It's a garden
        life You are the weeping willow And I am alcohol Swimming through your
        system Lulling you to sleep On and on we dream What comes after me? (We
        can't stay forever) What comes after me? (We can't stay forever) What
        comes after me? (We can't stay forever) What comes after me? (We can't
        stay forever) What comes after me? (We can't stay forever) You left a
        dent inside my soul, ooh (we can't stay forever) I'm on the edge, where
        do I go? What comes after me? (We can't stay forever)
